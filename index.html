<p>For this project I developed the doors and room transition systems. I implemented the audio manager for sound effects and music. I collaborated in creating a new game mechanic and designed some of the new custom levels. I also aided in programming the movement code. I used C# to write scripts to implement functionality through components in Unity.</p>
